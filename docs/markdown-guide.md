### Banner Limitations and Notes

**Important guidelines:**

The rest of your markdown content continues normally...
```

## Images and Media

### Basic Image Syntax

```markdown
![Alt text](image-filename.jpg)
![Alt text with title](image-filename.jpg "Image title")
```

### Image Storage

**Client-side images:**

Place images in the appropriate directory:

```
app/public/images/
```

Reference them in markdown:

```markdown
![Device setup](/images/device-setup.jpg)
```

### Image Optimization

**Best practices:**

- Use WebP format when possible for smaller file sizes
- Compress images before uploading
- Recommended max width: 1920px for hero images, 800px for inline images
- Use descriptive filenames: `antenna-setup-diagram.jpg` not `img001.jpg`
- Always include meaningful alt text for accessibility

**Example with proper alt text:**

```markdown
![T1000-E device showing the power button location on the right side](/images/t1000e-power-button.jpg)
```

### Hero Images

Hero images are configured in frontmatter and displayed at the top of pages:

```yaml
---
title: "Getting Started"
heroImage: "mesh-network-hero.jpg"
attributionUrl: "https://unsplash.com/photos/example"
---
```

**Hero image guidelines:**

- Dimensions: 1920x600px recommended
- Format: JPG or WebP
- File size: Keep under 500KB
- Choose images with good contrast for text overlay
- Always provide attribution for stock photos

## Code Blocks

### Inline Code

Use single backticks for inline code:

```markdown
The `configure()` function accepts a `ConfigObject` parameter.
```

### Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting

Use triple backticks with language identifier:

````markdown
```javascript
const device = new MeshtasticDevice();
device.connect();
```
````

**Supported languages:**

- `javascript` / `js`
- `typescript` / `ts`
- `python`
- `bash` / `shell`
- `json`
- `yaml`
- `markdown` / `md`
- `html`
- `css`
- `csharp` / `cs`

### Code Block Examples

**JavaScript:**

````markdown
```javascript
function setupChannel(name, frequency) {
  return {
    name: name,
    frequency: frequency,
    psk: generatePSK(),
  };
}
```
````

**Python:**

````markdown
```python
def configure_device(device_id, settings):
    device = MeshtasticDevice(device_id)
    device.apply_settings(settings)
    return device.status
```
````

**Command line:**

````markdown
```bash
# Install Meshtastic CLI
pip install meshtastic

# Check device connection
meshtastic --info
```
````

**Configuration files:**

````markdown
```yaml
device:
  name: "Node-001"
  region: "US"
  role: "ROUTER"
channels:
  - name: "LongFast"
    frequency: 915.0
```
````

## Frontmatter Configuration

### Pages

Pages use frontmatter for configuration and metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
subtitle: "Optional subtitle for hero section"
heroImage: "image-filename.jpg"
attributionUrl: "https://source-attribution-url.com"
---
```

**Fields:**

- **title** (required): Main page title
- **subtitle** (optional): Displayed in hero section
- **heroImage** (optional): Background image for hero section
- **attributionUrl** (optional): Attribution link for hero image

### Updates

Updates require specific frontmatter for proper display:

```yaml
---
title: "Update Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
summary: "Brief description of the update content"
tag: "category-name"
---
```

**Fields:**

- **title** (required): Update title for listings and display
- **date** (required): Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **summary** (required): Brief summary for update listings
- **tag** (optional): Category tag for filtering and organization

## Pages and Updates

### Page Structure

Pages have static content and get their own listing in the header menu:

```
/pages/page-name.md
```

**Example page:**

```markdown
---
title: "Channel Settings Guide"
subtitle: "Configure your Meshtastic device channels"
---

# Channel Configuration

This guide covers how to set up and configure channels...

::info[Quick Start]
Most users can use the default channel settings for basic operation.
::info

## Basic Setup

1. Open the Meshtastic app
2. Navigate to channel settings
   ...
```

### Update Structure

Updates are time-sensitive posts like news, announcements, or community updates, and show up on the home page:

```
/updates/update-filename.md
```

**Example update:**

```markdown
---
title: "Community Meeting Scheduled"
date: "2025-12-15"
summary: "Join us for our monthly community meeting to discuss network improvements and new features."
tag: "community"
---

# Monthly Community Meeting

We're excited to announce our next community meeting...
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive headings** - Make content scannable
2. **Break up long sections** - Use subheadings every few paragraphs
3. **Include relevant banners** - Highlight important information appropriately
4. **Front-load important information** - Put key points early
5. **Use active voice** - "Configure your device" vs "Your device should be configured"
6. **Include examples** - Show practical applications
7. **Link to related content** - Help users find additional information

### Banner Usage Guidelines

1. **Don't overuse banners** - They lose impact if used too frequently
2. **Choose appropriate types**:
   - `::info` for helpful tips and additional context
   - `::warning` for important notices and cautions
   - `::critical` for urgent issues and security warnings
3. **Keep banner content concise** - Long banners become hard to read
4. **Use markdown inside banners** - Enhance readability with formatting

### Frontmatter Best Practices

**For Pages:**

- Keep titles concise but descriptive
- Use subtitles to provide additional context
- Ensure hero images are optimized for web use
- Provide an attribution URL for any images sourced from the Internet.

**For Updates:**

- Use consistent date formatting (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Write compelling summaries for feed listings
- Use consistent tag naming (lowercase, hyphenated)

### File Organization

```
pages/
├── getting-started.md      # Main guides
├── recommended-settings.md # Specific topics
└── troubleshooting.md      # Support content

updates/
├── community-meeting.md    # Descriptive names
├── version-2-release.md    # Version releases
└── welcome-to-svmesh.md    # Announcements
```

**Note:** Use descriptive filenames rather than date prefixes. Dates should be specified in the frontmatter `date` field.

### Common Formatting Examples

**Tables**:

```markdown
| Device  | Battery Life | GPS | Price |
| ------- | ------------ | --- | ----- |
| T1000-E | 7 days       | Yes | $89   |
| R1 Neo  | 5 days       | Yes | $129  |
```

**Task Lists**:

```markdown
- [x] Complete basic setup
- [x] Configure channels
- [ ] Set up encryption
- [ ] Test messaging
```

**Complex Example**:

```markdown
# Device Configuration

::info[Before You Start]
Make sure your device is fully charged and connected to the Meshtastic app.
::info

## Step 1: Basic Setup

1. Open the Meshtastic app
2. Select your device from the list

::warning[Connection Issues]

::warning

## Step 2: Channel Configuration

Configure your channels using these settings:

| --------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Name      | "LongFast" | Default channel |
| Frequency | 915MHz     | US frequency    |

::critical[Important]
Never use channels that interfere with emergency services.
::critical

Your device is now ready for mesh networking!
```
